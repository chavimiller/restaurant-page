# restaurant-page

Project Summary
This project is a single-page restaurant website built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It focuses on practicing modular JavaScript, Webpack bundling, and DOM manipulation without relying on traditional HTML files for each page. Instead, all content is dynamically generated and rendered using JavaScript modules.

The goal of the project is to deepen understanding of:

    ES6 module imports and exports

    Setting up and configuring Webpack

    Creating and appending DOM elements with JavaScript

    Structuring a project for scalability and clarity

This is part of the curriculum from The Odin Project's JavaScript path and serves as an introduction to modern frontend project architecture.
